DevOps Assignment

Five DevOps Concepts

Continuous Integration (CI) 🔄
Frequently testing and merging code to avoid conflicts.
CI tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and GitLab CI automate testing and integration.

Continuous Deployment (CD) 🚀
Automatically deploying successfully tested code into production without manual steps.
Helps deliver updates faster and more reliably.

Version Control (Git) 📘
Git tracks code changes, enables collaboration, and maintains project history.
Developers can work on separate features without disturbing each other.

Containerization (Docker) 📦
Docker packages applications with all dependencies into portable containers.
Ensures the same behavior across Mac, Windows, Linux, servers, and cloud systems.

Automation ⚙️
Eliminates repetitive manual work.
Used for automated building, testing, monitoring, and deployment tasks.

How I Completed This Assignment (Extended Explanation)

🐳 Docker Commands Used

docker build -t devops-assignment .
docker tag devops-assignment maulipatil2/devops-assignment:v1
docker push maulipatil2/devops-assignment:v1
📌 What These Docker Commands Do

docker build → Creates a Docker image using the Dockerfile.
docker tag → Assigns a version tag (v1) for pushing to Docker Hub.
docker push → Uploads the image to my Docker Hub repository.
This gave me hands-on experience in building and sharing container images.

📝 Git Commands Used

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/MauliPatil2/devops-demo-app
git push -u origin main
📌 What These Git Commands Do

git init → Creates a new Git repository.
git add → Stages all files for commit.
git commit → Saves project changes in Git history.
git remote add origin → Connects the project to GitHub.
git push → Uploads code to GitHub.
This taught me proper version control workflow used in software development.

What I Learned?
🐳 Learned how to build, tag, and upload Docker images.
💻 Understood basic Linux commands and how they work inside a container.
🔗 Learned how Git and GitHub manage source code effectively.
📦 Understood Docker image versioning (v1, v2, etc.).
☁️ Learned how Docker Hub acts as a cloud registry for storing images.
🔁 Understood the DevOps pipeline: Build → Tag → Push → Pull → Run.
📚 Experienced how automation makes deployments faster and error-free.
🤝 Understood how teams collaborate using Git branches and commits.
🌐 Saw how DevOps brings together development, version control, and containerization.
This assignment helped me understand real DevOps practices and how modern applications are built, packaged, and deployed.
